👋 Hi there! I'm Abiodun, a passionate software engineering student at the African Leadership University. My focus lies at the intersection of Machine Learning, Fintech, Technical Analysis, and Artificial Intelligence.

## About Me

- 🌱 I'm currently pursuing my degree in Software Engineering, diving deep into the fascinating world of ML algorithms and data-driven solutions.
- 💡 As the Founder and CTO of Trade Monastery®, I've developed proprietary technical analysis strategies and systems. Our approach revolves around analyzing financial markets based solely on price action (OHLC prices). But that's just the beginning!
- 🚀 My vision? To transform these techniques into powerful ML models for autonomous trading algorithms. I'm determined to create systems that can compete effectively against even the biggest hedge funds globally.
- 🌍 Beyond the code, I'm passionate about forging a new paradigm for Africa within the global financial ecosystem. Let's redefine what's possible!
